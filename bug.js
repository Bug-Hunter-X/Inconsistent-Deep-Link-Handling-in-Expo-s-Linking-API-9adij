This error occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links, especially when dealing with custom URL schemes.  The issue manifests as an unexpected behavior where the app doesn't respond to a deep link, even though the URL scheme is correctly registered and the `Linking.addEventListener` is set up properly.  This can be further complicated by situations where the app works as expected in some cases but not others, leading to inconsistent behavior.  The underlying cause often involves race conditions or asynchronous issues where the listener might not be fully active when the deep link is received.  This bug often shows no explicit error message in the console, making it difficult to diagnose.
